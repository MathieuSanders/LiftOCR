# LiftOCR

> *Recover the story. Lift the words.*

LiftOCR is a modular, open-source OCR framework designed for clean architecture, easy expansion, and flexible document OCR using machine learning (ML)-based recognition.

---

## Features

- Modular Python OCR pipeline
- ML-Based Recognizer using EasyOCR or Tesseract
- Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) enforce module structure
- Swappable components via YAML configuration
- Command-line interface with output folder override
- GPU acceleration supported with CUDA-backed PyTorch
- install_torch.py for smart PyTorch installation
- uninstall_torch.py for easy cleanup
- Clean software architecture & project management example

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuSanders/LiftOCR.git
cd LiftOCR
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install the correct version of PyTorch based on your system:

```bash
python tools/install_torch.py
```

This script will:
- Detect your system's GPU (if any)
- Detect CUDA version
- Recommend the best PyTorch install option
- Handle CPU-only installs if no GPU is found

---

## Uninstall PyTorch (Optional)

To cleanly remove PyTorch, EasyOCR, and related packages:

```bash
python tools/uninstall_torch.py
```

This will:
- Uninstall torch, torchvision, torchaudio, easyocr, pytesseract
- Clear cached files from local storage
- Verify removal

---

## Usage

### Command-Line OCR Execution

Run LiftOCR from the command line:

```bash
python main.py --input path/to/image.jpg --output path/to/output_folder
```

Arguments:
- `--input` (required) = path to your input image
- `--output` (optional) = overrides output folder in config.yaml

Results will be saved as `.txt` file in the output folder.

---

## Configuration

Configuration file:

```
config/config.yaml
```

Control the pipeline flow:
- Preprocessor
- Segmenter
- Recognizer (ML-based)
- Postprocessor
- Output

Example:

```yaml
recognizer: ocr.modules.recognize.model.ModelRecognizer
recognizer_engine: easyocr   # or tesseract
output_path: output/
log_level: INFO
```

Ensure PyTorch is installed correctly for your chosen recognizer and engine.
